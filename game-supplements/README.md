# T.I.M.E. STORIES - Game supplement
This is a game supplement for the absolutely awesome board game "T.I.M.E. Stories" by Manuel Rozoy [http://www.spacecowboys.fr/time-stories](http://www.spacecowboys.fr/time-stories).

## What is it good for?
It's intended to help who ever is in charge of taking notes during a "T.I.M.E. Stories" session. The goal is to reduce the amount of text that is required to be noted down, thus increase the fun for all players in the game.

## Files/Content
- `time-stories-protocol_german.indd` The InDesign file for the german version
- `time-stories-protocol_german.pdf` The print ready PDF for the german version
- `time-stories-protocol_english.indd` The InDesign file for the english version
- `time-stories-protocol_english.pdf` The print ready PDF for the english version


### How is it intended to be used?
One of those sheets is to be used per single game location. Each horizontal block is intended to be used for a single location card.

#### Header
In the header of the document the "Location" this page refers to should be noted.

#### First three columns
- The first column is inteded to note down the letter of the location card "B"/"C"/"D"/... for this horizontal block
- The second column (red lock) should be marked if a card - if activated - forces the characters to stay on the card until all checks are passed.
- The third column (time symbol with red lock) contain the number of time units this card forces to spend when activated
#### The vertical "TO BE USED" (gray background) column
- First column: The state markers required / give you an advantage to perform actions that are revealed by activating the card  ... OR the state marker required to activate this card (wORK IN PROGRESS - this should be make more clear).
- Second colum: The objects that are required / give you an advantage to perform actions that are revealed by activating the card. Put the object number(s) in this column.
- Third column: Generic tokens required / give you an advantage to perform actions that are revealed by activating the card
#### The vertical "CHECKS" column
The checks the characters will have to perform on this field will (AND / OR).
- First column: How hard (number of shields - put in the box below the shield icon) a check on which skill (free text) needs to be passed
- Second column: Which fight checks need to be passed. (If not "type of fight" symbol - e.g. short range or long range combar - is marked, no special fight type check needs to be passed)

#### The vertical "LOOT" column
- Just like the "TO BE USED" column, but the stuff here is the stuff you can gain from this field, instead of "using them"
#### The vertial "NOTES" column
- Free text area to put additional notes

## What is the development status
It currently is pre-alpha and has not been play testet yet. I'll probably improve this, based on the outcome of the play tests. (Don't take my word on this, you know how those "hobby projects" go ... ^^)

## What languages are supported?
Currently there is an english and a german version. (Thinking about ditching the german version...).

## Tools and Resources used
It was built using Adobe InDesign and the Icons from the official ["Scenerio Designer's Kit"](http://www.spacecowboys.fr/files/games/time-stories/designer-kits/Designer-Kit-us.zip).
